I'm a PhD candidate in the [Department of Astronomy/Steward Observatory](astro.arizona.edu) at the University of Arizona.

My research uses the James Webb Space Telescope to study galaxies from the nearby to the distant Universe. I'm interested in understanding how star formation, black hole growth, and major mergers work together to change galaxies over cosmic time, especially when obscured by dust.

I also work with the [TIMESTEP](timestep.arizona.edu) program to mentor and increase retention and hiring of undergraduate physics and astronomy students, and foster middle and high schoolers' interest in astronomy with [Arizona Astronomy Camp](astronomycamp.info).
